# DSAN 6725 Project Ideas

Here are some project ideas for Gen AI projects. The focus of each of these ideas is to build out a complete applied science use-case, it is expected that each of these ideas would be worked upon by a team of 2-4 graduate students for 6 to 8 weeks.

The ideas focus on Agentic AI use-case but some also include exploration of core components such as an embedding model, specific optimization technique or building benchmarks.
